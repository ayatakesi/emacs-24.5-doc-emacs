"@kbd{C-x @key{ESC} @key{ESC}} re-executes a recent command that used the "

"@kbd{C-x @key{ESC} @key{ESC}} works by turning the previous command into a "
"Lisp expression and then entering a minibuffer initialized with the text for "
"that expression.  Even if you don't know Lisp, it will probably be obvious "
"which command is displayed for repetition.  If you type just @key{RET}, that "
"repeats the command unchanged.  You can also change the command by editing "
"the Lisp expression before you execute it.  The executed command is added to "
"the front of the command history unless it is identical to the most recent "
"item."

"can edit its expression as usual and then execute it by typing @key{RET}."
