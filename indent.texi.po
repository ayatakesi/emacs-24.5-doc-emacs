"The simplest way to perform indentation is the @key{TAB} key.  In most major "

"The exact behavior of @key{TAB} depends on the major mode.  In Text mode and "

"and tab characters to advance point to the next tab stop (@pxref{Tab "
"Stops}).  For this purpose, the position of the first non-whitespace "
"character on the preceding line is treated as an additional tab stop, so you "
"can use @key{TAB} to ``align'' point with the preceding line.  If the region "
"is active (@pxref{Using Region}), @key{TAB} acts specially: it indents each "
"line in the region so that its first non-whitespace character is aligned "
