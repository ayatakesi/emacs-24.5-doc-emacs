"Global Auto Revert Mode normally only reverts file buffers.  There are two "
"ways to auto-revert certain non-file buffers: by enabling Auto Revert Mode "
"in those buffers (using @kbd{M-x auto-revert-mode}); and by setting "
"@code{global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers} to a non-@code{nil} value.  The "
"latter enables Auto Reverting for all types of buffers for which it is "
"implemented (listed in the menu below)."

"Like file buffers, non-file buffers should normally not revert while you are "
"working on them, or while they contain information that might get lost after "
"reverting.  Therefore, they do not revert if they are ``modified''.  This "
"can get tricky, because deciding when a non-file buffer should be marked "
"modified is usually more difficult than for file buffers."

"Another tricky detail is that, for efficiency reasons, Auto Revert often "
"does not try to detect all possible changes in the buffer, only changes that "
"are ``major'' or easy to detect.  Hence, enabling auto-reverting for a "
"non-file buffer does not always guarantee that all information in the buffer "
"is up-to-date, and does not necessarily make manual reverts useless."

"At the other extreme, certain buffers automatically revert every "

"Dired buffers only auto-revert when the file list of the buffer's main "
"directory changes (e.g., when a new file is added).  They do not auto-revert "
"when information about a particular file changes (e.g., when the size "
"changes) or when inserted subdirectories change.  To be sure that @emph{all} "
"listed information is up to date, you have to manually revert using @kbd{g}, "
"@emph{even} if auto-reverting is enabled in the Dired buffer.  Sometimes, "
"you might get the impression that modifying or saving files listed in the "
"main directory actually does cause auto-reverting.  This is because making "
"changes to a file, or saving it, very often causes changes in the directory "
"itself; for instance, through backup files or auto-save files.  However, "

"If the Dired buffer is marked modified and there are no changes you want to "
"protect, then most of the time you can make auto-reverting resume by "
"manually reverting the buffer using @kbd{g}.  There is one exception.  If "
"you flag or mark files, you can safely revert the buffer.  This will not "
"erase the flags or marks (unless the marked file has been deleted, of "
"course).  However, the buffer will stay modified, even after reverting, and "
"auto-reverting will not resume.  This is because, if you flag or mark files, "
"you may be working on the buffer and you might not want the buffer to change "
"without warning.  If you want auto-reverting to resume in the presence of "
"marks and flags, mark the buffer non-modified using @kbd{M-~}.  However, "
"adding, deleting or changing marks or flags will mark it modified again."
