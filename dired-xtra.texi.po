"to reinsert or delete subdirectories that were inserted with explicit "
"switches can bypass Dired's machinery for remembering (or forgetting) "
"switches.  Deleting a subdirectory using @code{dired-undo} does not forget "
"its switches.  When later reinserted using @kbd{i}, it will be reinserted "
"using its old switches.  Using @code{dired-undo} to reinsert a subdirectory "
"that was deleted using the regular Dired commands (not @code{dired-undo})  "
"will originally insert it with its old switches.  Reverting the buffer, "
"however, will relist it using the buffer's default switches.  If any of this "
"yields problems, you can easily correct the situation using @kbd{C-u i} or "
"@kbd{C-u l}."

"Dired does not remember the @code{R} switch.  Inserting a subdirectory with "

"its subdirectories using all remaining switches.  For instance, updating or "
"killing a subdirectory that was inserted with the @code{R} switch will not "
"update or kill its subdirectories."
