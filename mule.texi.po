"the logical order or on stretches of buffer positions may produce unusual "
"effects.  For example, @kbd{C-f} and @kbd{C-b} commands move point in the "
"logical order, so the cursor will sometimes jump when point traverses "
"reordered bidirectional text.  Similarly, a highlighted region covering a "
"contiguous range of character positions may look discontinuous if the region "
"spans reordered text.  This is normal and similar to the behavior of other "
"programs that support bidirectional text.  If you set "
"@code{visual-order-cursor-movement} to a non-@code{nil} value, cursor motion "
"by the arrow keys follows the visual order on screen (@pxref{Moving Point, "
"visual-order movement})."
