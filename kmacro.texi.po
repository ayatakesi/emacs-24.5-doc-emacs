"A @dfn{keyboard macro} is a command defined by an Emacs user to stand for "
"another sequence of keys.  For example, if you discover that you are about "
"to type @kbd{C-n M-d C-d} forty times, you can speed your work by defining a "
"keyboard macro to do @kbd{C-n M-d C-d}, and then executing it 39 more times."

"You define a keyboard macro by executing and recording the commands which "
"are its definition.  Put differently, as you define a keyboard macro, the "
"definition is being executed for the first time.  This way, you can see the "
"effects of your commands, so that you don't have to figure them out in your "
"head.  When you close the definition, the keyboard macro is defined and also "
"has been, in effect, executed once.  You can then do the whole thing over "
"again by invoking the macro."

"Keyboard macros differ from ordinary Emacs commands in that they are written "
"in the Emacs command language rather than in Lisp.  This makes it easier for "
"the novice to write them, and makes them more convenient as temporary "
"hacks.  However, the Emacs command language is not powerful enough as a "
"programming language to be useful for writing anything intelligent or "
"general.  For such things, Lisp must be used."
