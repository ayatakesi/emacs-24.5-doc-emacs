"The usual way to invoke Emacs is with the shell command @command{emacs}.  "

"the background with @command{emacs &}; this way, Emacs won't tie up the "
"terminal window, so you can use it to run other shell commands."

"When Emacs starts up, the initial frame displays a special buffer named "
"@samp{*GNU Emacs*}.  This @dfn{startup screen} contains information about "
"Emacs and @dfn{links} to common tasks that are useful for beginning users.  "
"For instance, activating the @samp{Emacs Tutorial} link opens the Emacs "
"tutorial; this does the same thing as the command @kbd{C-h t} "
"(@code{help-with-tutorial}).  To activate a link, either move point onto it "
"and type @kbd{@key{RET}}, or click on it with @kbd{mouse-1} (the left mouse "
"button)."

"Using a command line argument, you can tell Emacs to visit one or more files "
"as soon as it starts up.  For example, @command{emacs foo.txt} starts Emacs "
"with a buffer displaying the contents of the file @samp{foo.txt}.  This "
"feature exists mainly for compatibility with other editors, which are "
"designed to be launched from the shell for short editing sessions.  If you "
"call Emacs this way, the initial frame is split into two windows---one "
"showing the specified file, and the other showing the startup screen.  "

"Generally, it is unnecessary and wasteful to start Emacs afresh each time "
"you want to edit a file.  The recommended way to use Emacs is to start it "
"just once, just after you log in, and do all your editing in the same Emacs "
"session.  @xref{Files}, for information on visiting more than one file.  If "
"you use Emacs this way, the Emacs session accumulates valuable context, such "
"as the kill ring, registers, undo history, and mark ring data, which "
"together make editing more convenient.  These features are described later "
"in the manual."
