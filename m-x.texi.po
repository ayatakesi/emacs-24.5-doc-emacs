"Every Emacs command has a name that you can use to run it.  For convenience, "
"many commands also have key bindings.  You can run those commands by typing "
"the keys, or run them by name.  Most Emacs commands have no key bindings, so "
"the only way to run them is by name.  (@xref{Key Bindings}, for how to set "
"up key bindings.)"

"By convention, a command name consists of one or more words, separated by "
"hyphens; for example, @code{auto-fill-mode} or @code{manual-entry}.  Command "

"To run a command by name, start with @kbd{M-x}, type the command name, then "
"terminate it with @key{RET}.  @kbd{M-x} uses the minibuffer to read the "
"command name.  The string @samp{M-x} appears at the beginning of the "
"minibuffer as a @dfn{prompt} to remind you to enter a command name to be "
"run.  @key{RET} exits the minibuffer and runs the command.  "

"When the command you run with @kbd{M-x} has a key binding, Emacs mentions "

"In this manual, when we speak of running a command by name, we often omit "

"the @key{RET} only for emphasis, such as when the command is followed by "
