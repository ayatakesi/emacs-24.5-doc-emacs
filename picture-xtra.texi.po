"The Picture mode commands for yanking rectangles differ from the standard "
"ones in that they overwrite instead of inserting.  This is the same way that "
"Picture mode insertion of other text differs from other modes.  @kbd{C-c "
"C-y} (@code{picture-yank-rectangle}) inserts (by overwriting) the rectangle "
"that was most recently killed, while @kbd{C-c C-x} "
"(@code{picture-yank-rectangle-from-register}) does likewise for the "
"rectangle found in a specified register."
